My own algorithm implement using C language. Learning from some algorithm books, such as intoduction 
to algorithm and programming pearls, I implement the basic idea. Push the code into github for backing.

The algorithm mainly include:
sorting algorithms

	insert sort
	select sort
	buffer sort
	merge sort
	quick sort 
	heap sort

	counting sort
	radix sort

search algorthms

	find the max and mix
	rondamized median algorithm
	hash 

basic data structure

	link lisk
	stack
	queue
	binary tree

divide and conquer

dynamic programming

graph(network) algorithms

string problem
